# mem-safe-rbt: project rules
## Commands
- Build & unit tests: ‘make test‘
- Sanitizers: ‘make asan‘ Valgrind: ‘make memcheck‘
- Nothing is DONE until all three (make test, make asan, make memcheck) pass.
## Constraints
- NEVER modify include/rbtree.h.
- NEVER make a git commit.
- All heap allocation in src/ goes through rb_malloc/rb_free
(tests/fault_alloc.h). Direct malloc/free in src/ is a defect.
- Any allocation may fail. Every failure path must unwind completely:
no leaks, tree left exactly as before the call, documented error code.
- NEVER weaken, skip, or delete a test to make the suite pass. If a test
looks wrong, stop and explain why instead.
## Style
- C23. -Wall -Wextra -Werror must stay clean. No VLAs.
- Error handling: goto-cleanup pattern for multi-allocation functions.
- Prefer the smallest diff that passes. Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Every non-obvious loop gets a one-line invariant comment.
- Commit only from a green state; message format "M<n>: <what>".
